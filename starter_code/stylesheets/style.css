/* Apologies, I had to start on this at 4 am, spent most of my time reading the course materials, only managed a few lines of code as I didn't really know where to start, then wasted time trying to push it back to the original author. I just now created a new fork so I could upload it, but managed to delete the little I code I actually wrote. Sorry. Will take a look at it now. At least I'm getting the hang of github.
